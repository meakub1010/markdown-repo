### Kubernetes
- open source container orchestration platform that automates
    - Deployment
    - Scalling
    - Load balancing
    - Management of containerized applications
    - developed by Google
**Need**
- Trend from Monolith to Microservices
- Increased usage of containers

**Offers**
- high availability or no downtime
- scalability or high performance
- disaster recovery, backup and restore

**BASIC ARCHITECTURE**
**Cluster**
    - At least one master node
    - Multiple worker nodes
    - Each node has **kubelet** process running on it
        **kubelet**, k8 process that enable nodes to talk to each other and also execute some tasks
    - On worker nodes that hold docker containers, where your application is running
    - Master node also run some processes that are absolutely necessary in order to make sure 
        - API server, that also a container
        - UI and API to manage the K8 cluster will talk to this API server
        - Controller manager
            - keeps track of whats happening in the cluster
        - Scheduler, schedule containers on different nodes based on the work load and available resources
        - etcd, key value store that holds state of k8 cluster
    - Virtual Network enable communications among all nodes in cluster

**POD**
- smallest unit k8 user can configure
- wraper of a container
- in general one pod hold one container but depending on the app needs it can hold multiple containers
- each pod has it's own internal IP address
- if pod dies, it get recreated and get new IP address
- **Service** in k8 what synchronize the new IP address so user don't get interrupted with new IP address
    - Service has permanent IP address that we can connect to
    - Load balancing

### Core K8 Concepts and Definitions
| Term            | Definition                                                                | Example                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pod**         | The smallest deployable unit in K8s. Wraps one or more containers.        | A pod runs a single nginx container.               |
| **Deployment**  | Manages the desired state for Pods. Supports rolling updates & rollbacks. | Deploy an app with 3 replicas.                     |
| **ReplicaSet**  | Ensures a specific number of pod replicas are running at any time.        | Keeps 5 pods of the same app alive.                |
| **Service**     | Exposes pods internally (ClusterIP), externally (NodePort, LoadBalancer). | Load balancer routes traffic to your app.          |
| **Ingress**     | Manages external HTTP(S) access to services. Supports routing & TLS.      | Routes `/api` to one service, `/admin` to another. |
| **Namespace**   | Virtual cluster within a K8s cluster for isolation of resources.          | Dev and prod apps can run in separate namespaces.  |
| **ConfigMap**   | Stores config data in key-value format.                                   | Inject environment variables into a container.     |
| **Secret**      | Stores sensitive data (like passwords, API keys), base64-encoded.         | Inject DB credentials securely.                    |
| **Volume**      | Persistent storage attached to pods.                                      | Mount a PVC for database pod data.                 |
| **StatefulSet** | Like Deployment, but for stateful apps with stable identity and storage.  | Running MongoDB or Kafka.                          |
| **DaemonSet**   | Ensures a pod runs on **every node**.                                     | Log collectors like Fluentd.                       |
| **Job/CronJob** | Runs pods for **one-off** or **scheduled** tasks.                         | DB backup every midnight.                          |
| **Node**        | A physical/VM server in the cluster running containerized workloads.      | AWS EC2 node runs multiple pods.                   |
| **Kubelet**     | Agent running on each node to manage the state of that node's pods.       | Checks pod health, talks to control plane.         |
| **kubectl**     | CLI tool to interact with Kubernetes cluster.                             | `kubectl get pods`                                 |


    

### What is the difference between a Pod and a Deployment?
A Pod is a single instance of a running process in your cluster. A Deployment manages Pods and ensures the desired number of replicas are running and updated.

### How do you expose a service in Kubernetes?
Use a Service (ClusterIP for internal, NodePort or LoadBalancer for external), or Ingress for HTTP routing.

kubectl expose deployment myapp --type=LoadBalancer --port=80

### What is a ConfigMap vs Secret?
ConfigMap stores non-sensitive config.

Secret stores sensitive info like API keys (base64 encoded).

### What is a Namespace and when would you use it?
A namespace provides scope for resources. Use it for separating environments (dev, test, prod) or by teams.

### How does rolling update work in Kubernetes?
A Deployment updates pods incrementally using strategies like RollingUpdate. It replaces old pods gradually with new ones to avoid downtime.
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 1
    maxSurge: 1
### What is a PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim?
PV: actual storage resource in the cluster.

PVC: user's request for storage (claim).

###  What is a DaemonSet?
A DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a pod runs on every node. Great for logging agents, monitoring, etc.

### How do you troubleshoot a failed Pod?
`kubectl describe pod <pod-name> – events & errors

kubectl logs <pod-name> – stdout logs

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- bash – shell access`

### What is the role of etcd in Kubernetes?
Answer:
etcd is a distributed key-value store used by Kubernetes to store all cluster data and state.

### What is Helm?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and upgrade complex K8s applications using charts.

### YAML Example: Simple Deployment + Service
`apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp

    - port: 80
