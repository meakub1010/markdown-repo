### 👉DDL - Data Definition Language
Used to define or modify the structure of database objects (tables, schemas, etc.)

| Command    | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `CREATE`   | Create new table, database, index, etc.           |
| `ALTER`    | Modify an existing table structure                |
| `DROP`     | Delete table, view, or database                   |
| `TRUNCATE` | Remove all rows from a table (faster than DELETE) |
| `RENAME`   | Rename database objects (not in all DBs)          |


_📌 These commands define the schema. They are auto-committed (cannot be rolled back)._

### 👉DML – Data Manipulation Language

Used to work with the actual data inside tables

| Command  | Description                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `SELECT` | Retrieve data from one or more tables     |
| `INSERT` | Add new rows to a table                   |
| `UPDATE` | Modify existing rows                      |
| `DELETE` | Remove rows from a table                  |
| `MERGE`  | Insert/update based on condition (UPSERT) |

_📌 These are transactional (can be rolled back or committed)._


### 👉DCL – Data Control Language
Used to control access to data in the database

| Command  | Description                 |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| `GRANT`  | Give user access privileges |
| `REVOKE` | Take away user privileges   |

### 🚀 Why TRUNCATE is Faster Than DELETE
**✔ 1. TRUNCATE does not delete row-by-row**

**DELETE:**

- Removes each row one at a time
- Logs each row removal
- Fires triggers
- Checks constraints
- Generates undo/rollback entries

**TRUNCATE:**

- Removes the whole data segment at once
- Just deallocates pages/extents
- Minimal logging
- No row-level operations
- truncate reset identity column

_👉 It’s like dropping the table contents instantly._

**✔ 2. TRUNCATE is minimally logged**

**DELETE**

- Logs: every row deleted
- Slow when millions of rows

**TRUNCATE**

- Logs only: deallocation of pages
- Constant time (O(1)), not dependent on number of rows

Example:
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE Orders;
-- reset identity

DELETE FROM Orders;
-- does not reset identity
```
_Resetting identity avoids extra overhead for the next inserts._

**Example Speed Difference**
| Operation            | Time          |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| DELETE FROM logs;    | ❌ 3–5 minutes |
| TRUNCATE TABLE logs; | 🚀 < 1 second |

**Important Differences**

| Feature               | DELETE          | TRUNCATE                         |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Row-by-row delete     | ✔ Yes           | ❌ No                             |
| Logs each row         | ✔ Yes           | ❌ Minimal                        |
| Triggers fire         | ✔ Yes           | ❌ No                             |
| Respects WHERE clause | ✔ Yes           | ❌ No WHERE allowed               |
| Can rollback          | ✔ Yes           | ✔ Usually yes (depends on DB)    |
| Resets identity       | ❌ No            | ✔ Yes                            |
| Needs table locks     | ❌ No (row/page) | ✔ Yes (schema modification lock) |

**Summary (Easy to Remember)**

**DELETE** = Slow, row-by-row, logs everything
**TRUNCATE** = Fast, wipes whole table instantly, minimal logging
**DROP** = Removes table entirely

### How to write MERGE and UPSERT Query
```SQL
MERGE INTO target_table AS target
USING source_table AS source
ON target.id = source.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET target.name = source.name
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (id, name)
    VALUES (source.id, source.name);
```
**Let’s say we have a table Employees and want to insert or update records from NewEmployees.**
```SQL
MERGE INTO Employees AS e
USING NewEmployees AS ne
ON e.EmployeeID = ne.EmployeeID
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET 
        e.Name = ne.Name,
        e.Department = ne.Department
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (EmployeeID, Name, Department)
    VALUES (ne.EmployeeID, ne.Name, ne.Department);
```

### 🔹 @@IDENTITY

**Definition:**
Returns the last identity value inserted into an identity column in **any table in the current** session.

**Example:**
```SQL
INSERT INTO Users (Name) VALUES ('Alice');
SELECT @@IDENTITY;  -- Returns the ID generated for Alice
```

**⚠️ Caution:**
_It can return the identity value from a trigger if one was fired, which can lead to unexpected results._

### 🔹 SCOPE_IDENTITY()
Recommended alternative to **@@IDENTITY**

**Definition:**
Returns the last identity value inserted in the same scope.

**Example:**

```SQL
INSERT INTO Users (Name) VALUES ('Bob');
SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY();  -- Safe: Only returns Bob's ID
```

### 🔹 IDENT_CURRENT('TableName')
**Definition:**
Returns the last identity value generated for a specific table, regardless of session or scope.

**Example:**
```SQL
SELECT IDENT_CURRENT('Users');
```

_⚠️ Not limited to your session — use carefully in multi-user environments._


### Summary

| Function             | Returns identity from       | Session-Specific | Scope-Specific | Trigger-Safe |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| `@@IDENTITY`         | Last identity in session    | ✅                | ❌              | ❌            |
| `SCOPE_IDENTITY()`   | Last identity in same scope | ✅                | ✅              | ✅            |
| `IDENT_CURRENT('T')` | Last identity for table `T` | ❌                | ❌              | ✅            |


### What is PIVOT in SQL
In SQL, a **PIVOT** is used to transform rows into columns, allowing you to **reorganize and summarize data in a more readable or analytical format.**

```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM (
        SELECT customer_id, item, amount
        FROM Orders
    ) AS src
    PIVOT (
        SUM(amount)
        FOR item IN ([Keyboard], [Mouse], [Monitor], [Mousepad])
    ) AS PivotTable;
```


### What is Window function in SQL
A window function performs a calculation across a set of rows that are related to the current row, without collapsing the result into a single row (unlike aggregate functions with GROUP BY).

**🔍 Key Features:**
It works on a "window" (subset) of rows related to the current row.

The result is returned for every row, unlike GROUP BY which reduces rows.

Always used with the **OVER()** clause.

**Common Window Functions**

| Function          | Purpose                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `ROW_NUMBER()`    | Unique sequential number per row  |
| `RANK()`          | Ranking with gaps for ties        |
| `DENSE_RANK()`    | Ranking without gaps for ties     |
| `NTILE(n)`        | Divides rows into `n` buckets     |
| `SUM()`, `AVG()`  | Running totals or moving averages |
| `LAG()`, `LEAD()` | Access previous/next row values   |
| `FIRST_VALUE()`   | First value in the window         |
| `LAST_VALUE()`    | Last value in the window          |


```SQL

```
### ✅ 1. RANK() vs DENSE_RANK()
Both are window functions used for ranking rows based on a column's value. The difference is in how they handle ties (duplicate values).

**🔹 RANK():**
Skips ranking numbers after a tie.

Leaves a "gap" in the ranking.

**🔹 DENSE_RANK():**
No gaps — assigns the next available rank after a tie.

🧪 Example:
```SQL
SELECT name, score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM students;
```

### ✅ 2. Why use HAVING instead of WHERE?
🔹 **WHERE** filters rows **before aggregation.**
🔹 **HAVING** filters groups **after aggregation (GROUP BY).**
🧪 Example:
```SQL
    -- Invalid: WHERE can't use aggregate
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total
    FROM Orders
    WHERE SUM(amount) > 1000 -- ❌ ERROR
    GROUP BY customer_id;

    -- Correct: Use HAVING
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING SUM(amount) > 1000; -- ✅
```
➡️ Use HAVING when filtering on aggregated values like SUM(), COUNT(), etc.

### ✅ 3. How does MERGE handle concurrency?
MERGE (also known as upsert) combines INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE into a single atomic operation.

**🔒 Concurrency concerns:**
**Race conditions:** Two sessions may try to update/insert the same row.

**Deadlocks:** Can occur if multiple MERGE statements conflict.

**Lost updates:** If the same row is updated by different users.

**🔐 How to handle:**
Use Transactions:

Wrap MERGE in a transaction to ensure atomicity.

Apply Row-level Locking (SQL Server):

You can add hints like HOLDLOCK or SERIALIZABLE.
```SQL
MERGE target_table WITH (HOLDLOCK)
USING source_table
ON target_table.id = source_table.id
```

**Optimistic Concurrency:**

Use a version column or timestamp to detect conflicts.

Retry logic:

Handle deadlocks or concurrency failures in application logic.

➡️ Always test MERGE under concurrent loads to prevent phantom rows, double inserts, or updates being lost.


### ✅ What is a Cursor in SQL?
A cursor is a database object used to retrieve, manipulate, and iterate through a result set row by row — kind of like a pointer in programming that processes one row at a time.

### ✅ Why Use a Cursor?
Normally, SQL works on sets of rows (set-based operations). But sometimes you need row-by-row processing, especially when:

Performing operations with complex logic that can't be expressed in a single query.

Running procedural code in stored procedures or scripts.

### ✅ What is a CTE (Common Table Expression) in SQL?
A CTE (Common Table Expression) is a temporary, named result set you define within a WITH clause and use in a subsequent SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

**Example**
```SQL
WITH HighEarners AS (
    SELECT employee_id, name, salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE salary > 100000
)
SELECT * FROM HighEarners;
```

### Temp table Vs Temp Variable
In SQL Server, temporary tables and table variables are both used to store temporary data — but they have different performance, scope, and use cases.

**Temporary Table**
```SQL
CREATE TABLE #TempTable (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Table Varaible**
```SQL
DECLARE @TempVar TABLE (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100)
)
```

**Example**
**✅ Table Variable:**
```SQL
DECLARE @Products TABLE (product_id INT, name VARCHAR(50));
INSERT INTO @Products VALUES (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Orange');
SELECT * FROM @Products;
```
**✅ Temp Table:**
```SQL
CREATE TABLE #Products (product_id INT, name VARCHAR(50));
INSERT INTO #Products VALUES (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Orange');
SELECT * FROM #Products;
```
**Global Temp Table**
```SQL
CREATE TABLE ##GlobalTempTable
-- visible across all sessions
```

**🔍 2. Key Differences**
| Feature               | #Temporary Table (`#TempTable`) | @Table Variable (`@TempVar`)        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Scope**             | Connection/session level        | Batch/procedure level               |
| **Transaction log**   | Logged like regular tables      | Minimal logging                     |
| **Indexes**           | Can add indexes explicitly      | Limited (no explicit non-clustered) |
| **Statistics**        | Has statistics (optimizer uses) | No statistics                       |
| **Performance**       | **Better for large data**       | **Better for small datasets**       |
| **Persistence**       | Exists in `tempdb`              | In memory, also tempdb backed       |
| **ALTER allowed**     | Yes                             | ❌ No `ALTER` on structure          |
| **Used in recursion** | Yes                             | Not allowed in recursive CTE        |
| **Parallelism**       | Supported                       | Not supported                       |


### Normalization
**Normalization** is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The goal is to **divide large tables into smaller**, related ones and ensure dependencies make sense. It follows a series of "normal forms" (rules) that help refine the structure of your database.

#### Example

**🧱 Unnormalized Table (UNF)**
| StudentID | Name       | Courses       |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 1         | John Doe   | Math, Science |
| 2         | Jane Smith | History, Math |


#### 1️⃣ First Normal Form (1NF)
**Rule:** No repeating groups or arrays. All entries must be atomic (**single value per field**).
| StudentID | Name       | Course  |
| --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1         | John Doe   | Math    |
| 1         | John Doe   | Science |
| 2         | Jane Smith | History |
| 2         | Jane Smith | Math    |

#### 2️⃣ Second Normal Form (2NF)
Rule: Must be in 1NF and all non-key columns must depend on the whole primary key (**no partial dependency**).

Composite key: (StudentID, Course)

Split into two tables:

**Student**

| StudentID | Name       |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 1         | John Doe   |
| 2         | Jane Smith |

**StudentCourses**

| StudentID | Course  |
| --------- | ------- |
| 1         | Math    |
| 1         | Science |
| 2         | History |
| 2         | Math    |

#### 3️⃣ Third Normal Form (3NF)
Rule: Must be in 2NF and no transitive dependencies (non-key column depending on another non-key column).

Assume we added a column "Department" based on Course:

| StudentID | Course | Department |
| --------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1         | Math   | Science    |

**_This violates 3NF — "Department" depends on "Course", not "StudentID"._**

**Fix:**

**Courses**
| Course  | Department |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Math    | Science    |
| Science | Science    |
| History | Arts       |

Then update **StudentCourses:**
| StudentID | Course |
| --------- | ------ |
| 1         | Math   |

### Query-Level Optimization (Micro-Level)

These techniques make individual queries faster.

✅ a. Use Proper Indexing

Indexes reduce scan time by allowing fast lookups.

Common types:

- B-tree → for equality and range (WHERE age > 30)
- Hash → for equality only
- Composite index → for multi-column filters
- Covering index → query satisfied entirely by index

CREATE INDEX idx_emp_dept_salary
ON employees(dept_id, salary);


Tip:
→ Don’t over-index (hurts write performance).
→ Analyze queries with EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE.

✅ b. Avoid SELECT *

Fetch only what’s needed:
SELECT id, name FROM employees;


→ Reduces I/O and network overhead.

✅ c. Use Joins Wisely

Prefer INNER JOIN over OUTER JOIN when possible.
**Ensure joined columns are indexed.**
**Avoid joining large tables unnecessarily.**

✅ d. Optimize WHERE clauses

Use indexed columns in filters.

Avoid applying functions on indexed columns:
❌ WHERE YEAR(created_at) = 2025
✅ WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'

✅ e. Use Batching for Inserts / Updates

Instead of multiple single inserts:

INSERT INTO orders (id, amount)
VALUES (1, 100), (2, 200), (3, 300);

✅ f. Use Query Caching

Many RDBMS support query cache (or application-level cache like Redis).

Reduces repeated query execution cost.

### Schema and Data Design Optimization
✅ a. Normalize (but not over-normalize)

Normalization removes redundancy → smaller data → faster updates.

But over-normalization → too many joins → slower queries.

Balance: often go up to 3NF or BCNF, then selectively denormalize for performance.

✅ b. Partitioning (Sharding/Horizontal Partitioning)

Split a large table into smaller pieces based on a key.

CREATE TABLE orders_2025 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2026-01-01');


✅ Benefits:

Smaller indexes per partition
Easier maintenance and archiving
Faster queries with partition pruning

✅ c. Vertical Partitioning

**Split columns into multiple tables when not always needed:**
users_core(id, name, email)
users_profile(user_id, bio, preferences)


✅ Keeps hot data in memory more easily.

✅ d. Denormalization (for read-heavy systems)

Duplicate small amounts of data to avoid expensive joins.

Example:
Instead of joining employees with departments on every query, store dept_name in employees directly (if it changes rarely).

### System-Level Scaling (Macro-Level)
✅ a. Read-Write Splitting

Use replicas for reads (read scalability).
Writes go to primary node.

🧩 Example:

Primary DB → handles INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
Read Replicas → handle SELECT queries


Frameworks or ORMs (like Hibernate, Spring Data) can route queries accordingly.

✅ b. Connection Pooling
Avoid creating new DB connections for every query.
Use HikariCP, C3P0, or built-in Spring Boot pools.
Maintain a small pool (10–50 connections depending on load).

✅ c. Caching Layers

In-memory cache (Redis, Memcached) for frequent queries.
Application cache for small reference data (like currency codes, lookup tables).
Materialized Views for precomputed aggregates.

✅ d. Load Balancing Across DB Nodes

Distribute read traffic among replicas.
Some databases (like PostgreSQL + PgBouncer, MySQL Router) handle this automatically.

✅ e. Archiving and Data Lifecycle

Move old data to cold storage (cheaper & smaller active tables).
Improves performance of active queries.

✅ f. Use Proper Hardware and Configuration

Enough memory for buffer pool (so most queries hit RAM, not disk).
Tune DB parameters like:
innodb_buffer_pool_size (MySQL)
work_mem, shared_buffers (PostgreSQL)

### Monitoring and Profiling

Use tools like:

EXPLAIN, EXPLAIN ANALYZE → see execution plan
pg_stat_statements (PostgreSQL) → top slow queries
slow_query_log (MySQL)
APM tools (Datadog, New Relic, Prometheus + Grafana)

### Scaling Beyond a Single DB

If a single relational DB hits its limit:

Sharding → distribute rows across multiple databases

Federation / Data Virtualization → multiple sources appear as one logical DB

Hybrid models → use NoSQL for high-volume or unstructured parts

💼 Example — End-to-End Optimization Case
Problem:

Slow query fetching customer orders.

Fix:

Add composite index on (customer_id, order_date)
Archive old data to orders_archive
Use Redis for frequently viewed orders
Add read replica for analytics queries
Rewrite query to use WHERE order_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 DAYS'
Result → latency reduced from 2s → 80ms


🧠 What is Sharding?

Sharding = Horizontal partitioning of data across multiple databases or servers (called shards).
Each shard holds a subset of rows (not columns) of the same schema.

Example:

User table (sharded by user_id):
 ├── Shard 1 → user_id 1–1,000,000
 ├── Shard 2 → user_id 1,000,001–2,000,000
 ├── Shard 3 → user_id 2,000,001–3,000,000


✅ Goal: Scale horizontally, reduce single-node bottleneck, distribute load.

⚙️ Common Use Cases

High-traffic web apps (e.g., Facebook, Uber, Twitter)
SaaS multi-tenant platforms (tenant_id-based sharding)
Global systems with region-based data partitioning

⚠️ Key Challenges with Sharding SQL Databases

Below are top real-world challenges, explained like in an interview answer.

**1. Cross-Shard Joins and Queries**

Problem: SQL joins can’t span across shards easily.

Example:

SELECT * FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id;


If orders and users are on different shards, you can’t run this directly.

Workarounds:

Perform join in application logic (client-side join).
Use a data warehouse for analytical joins.
Denormalize some data (duplicate reference info across shards).

**2. Cross-Shard Transactions**

SQL transactions are typically ACID per shard, not across shards.

Example:

Transfer $100 from user A (Shard 1) → user B (Shard 2)


You can’t guarantee atomicity easily.

Possible solutions:

Use 2-Phase Commit (2PC) — but it’s slow and complex.
Use sagas or eventual consistency (common in microservices).

**3. Resharding (Rebalancing Data)**

When a shard grows too large or new shards are added, data must be redistributed.

Challenges:

Moving live data without downtime
Updating shard-mapping logic
Maintaining consistency during migration

Example:
Shard 1 (too large) → split into Shard 1A, 1B
You must re-route queries for affected keys safely.

**4. Hotspots (Uneven Load Distribution)**

Poor sharding key selection can cause one shard to get most of the traffic.

Example:

WHERE tenant_id = 'big_customer'


If one customer generates 90% of requests → that shard becomes a bottleneck.

Mitigation:

Choose shard key that distributes load evenly.
Use consistent hashing or range + hash hybrid.

**5. Global Aggregations and Analytics**

Operations like COUNT(*), SUM(), GROUP BY require aggregating across shards.

Example:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;


Now you need to:

Run query on all shards.
Merge results in the application or aggregator service.
This increases complexity and latency.

6. Schema Management and Migrations

Schema must stay consistent across all shards.

When you run:

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_login TIMESTAMP;


You must apply it to every shard, often with orchestration tools (like Flyway, Liquibase, or custom migration jobs).

7. Operational Complexity

Monitoring many shards (CPU, I/O, replication lag)
Managing backups and restores per shard
Version drift if shards evolve differently
Harder disaster recovery or failover

8. Application Logic Becomes Aware of Shards

You need to know which shard holds which data.
Typically involves a shard key lookup table:
user_id  → shard_id


Every query must first find the correct shard → adds latency and complexity.

9. Increased Maintenance Cost

More servers → more maintenance, replication, patching.

Harder to ensure uniform indexing and query tuning.

10. Data Integrity and Referential Constraints

Foreign key constraints can’t enforce relationships across shards.

Example:

users(id) on Shard 1
orders(user_id FK users.id) on Shard 2


→ You lose referential integrity unless enforced in application logic.

| Schema updates           | Each shard is separate     | Migration orchestration                  |
| Monitoring               | Many DBs                   | Centralized monitoring tools             |
| Foreign keys             | Tables split across shards | Enforce in application logic             |



### What’s the hardest part of sharding SQL databases?

“Maintaining consistency and supporting cross-shard queries and transactions without breaking ACID guarantees — this often leads to adopting eventual consistency and application-level aggregation patterns.”

### 🔹 2. Employees with higher salary than their department average

```SQL
-- subquery
SELECT e.* 
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) 
    FROM Employee
    WHERE department_id = e.department_id
);

SELECT e.* FROM Employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS AvgSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > d.AvgSalary;
```
### 🔹 3. Find duplicate records
```SQL
SELECT name, count(*) from Employees
group by name
having count(*)>1
```

### 🔹 4. Rank employees by salary in their department

```SQL
SELECT name, department_id, salary
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as SalaryRank
FROM Employees
```
✅ Uses RANK() with PARTITION BY, very common in analytical queries.

### 🔹 5. Find gaps in a sequence(missing dates or IDs)
```SQL
SELECT id+1 AS missing
FROM Invoice
WHERE id + 1 NOT IN (SELECT id from Invoice)
```

### SQL GROUP BY Basics

**GROUP BY** is used to aggregate rows based on one or more columns.

Example:
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

Here we group rows by department.

COUNT(*) gives the number of employees in each department.

✅ Works fine because all selected columns are either in the GROUP BY or aggregated.

**Why you cannot select other columns freely**

Suppose you try:
```sql
SELECT department, name
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

❌ This will fail in standard SQL (some databases allow it with extensions).

**Reason:**

When you group by department, multiple rows are combined into one group per department.

Which name should SQL pick?

There may be many names in that department.
SQL cannot guess which one you want.
SQL requires: Every column in SELECT must be either:
In the GROUP BY clause, or
Aggregated (using COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, etc.)

### Using ROW_NUMBER() (Recommended, ANSI SQL)
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) AS rn
    FROM employees
) t
WHERE rn % 2 = 1;  -- Odd rows
```
- % 2 = 1 → Odd rows
- % 2 = 0 → Even rows

Explanation:

- ROW_NUMBER() assigns a sequential number based on ORDER BY id.
- You can now filter odd or even row numbers.

### Duplicate employees by name and their frequencies
```sql
SELECT name, count(*) AS freq
FROM Employee
GROUP BY name
WHERE count(*) > 1;
```
- using cursor to return all cols
```sql
WITH dup AS (
    SELECT name
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY name
    HAVING count(*) > 1
)
SELECT e.* 
FROM Employee e
JOIN dup d ON d.name = e.name
```

### Display all employee whose name is exactly 4 chars
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE name LIKE '____';
```
